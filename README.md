# tongue-unlocker
Tongue unlocker helps language learners increase their vocabulary trough flash cards with new words to memorize, but grouped by environment.
New flash card decks can be collected by scanning, for example, your bedroom, a restaurant, the street and so on.
Trough Object Recognition ML Models the phone recognizes what is in front of the camera and automatically create a deck of new words for the user to start memorization.
The idea is to leverage the memorization technique known as Memory Palace, where the "Palace" would be the image/live capture the user takes.
